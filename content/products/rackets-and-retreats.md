**why I’m building a directory for racket sport vacations**

i recently posted about going on a tennis vacation on X. the response surprised me and my timeline was curious, and my DMs were full of questions which is when, I went down the rabbit hole.

reddit threads. niche forums. resort websites. word-of-mouth recommendations. and it became obvious: this is a real and growing category.

travel built around tennis is expanding fast. add the rise of pickleball and padel, and you’re looking at a broader shift — people are planning trips around racket sports. but discovering these experiences is still messy.

most existing websites:

- feel outdated
- have clunky UX
- focus only on one sport
- or are heavily US/EU-centric

there isn’t a clean, global directory that brings together: tennis camps, pickleball retreats, padel vacations, resort academies, hosted group trips.

all in one place. that’s the white space.

**what i’m building**

<span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">a curated web directory for tennis and adjacent racket sport vacations</span>.

the goal is simple: make it easy to discover, compare, and book high-quality racket sport experiences, anywhere in the world.

not just for tennis, but also for - pickleball and padel. it’s about lifestyle travel for people who want to move, play, and connect.

**how i’m building it**

this project will be entirely vibecoded and over time, I want to scale it the same way:

- AI-assisted product iteration
- AI-driven SEO and content
- AI-powered distribution and marketing
