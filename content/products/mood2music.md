the idea was pretty simple. you tell your mood, the app plays a song for your complimenting your mood. 

in this case, a nice playlist from youtube. just hit the play button ▶️ and continue with your work on your browser/machine!

i built this when i wanted to try out vibecoding using claude and actually built this a while ago when claude-code wasn't so mainstream. 

my workflow was pretty simple. i used <span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">create ai</span> (now known as **anything ai**) and have prompted my idea with multiple user-stories and features into the chatbox. also gave the UI/UX vibe i wanted and asked it to get inspired from spotify.  

hosted the whole thing on replit. it is a cool no-nonsense music player and takes away the friction of opening youtube and figuring out what to search for. 

try it for <span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">[yourself](https://mood2music.replit.app/)</span>!
