**the 1% club** 

because 99% can't. i personally think the biggest impediment to discipline and committment in life is the lack of accountability. staying committed to your habits and being disciplined is very tough in 2026 with doomscrolling and internet. but that's what the 99% of world is about and i think there should be a solution as to separate the 1% from the mediocre rest. 

**welcome to being the <span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">1 percenter</span> in life! 💯**

this will be an iOS app and hopefully on android too!
