## the challenge

from 2019–21, India’s next wave of internet users was coming online - largely from **tier-2 and tier-3 districts**, consuming content in their **native languages**, almost entirely on ***Android phones***.

this wasn’t a translation problem.

these users had little patience for clutter, weak networks, low-end devices, and zero loyalty to apps that didn’t deliver value immediately. in vernacular news, demand was massive — but **retention was broken**. bounce rates crossed 90%. distribution was fragmented. competition from players like DailyHunt, Dainik Bhaskar, TOI regional apps was intense.

the real question was simple and uncomfortable:

**<span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">how do you build products for Bharat that people actually come back to?</span>**

## the solution

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 my-4">                                                        
    <img src="/images/case-studies/image1.avif" alt="" class="aspect-square object-cover rounded-xl" />             
    <img src="/images/case-studies/image2.jpeg" alt="" class="aspect-square object-cover rounded-xl" />                        
  </div>   

i led product and growth across two vernacular media products with one guiding principle:

> Note: Design for familiarity, speed, and habit - not novelty.

- designed the **MVP for the Bulletin app**, optimised for fast discovery and district-level relevance
- rolled out a **district-first GTM**, expanding across 30+ districts instead of chasing vanity scale
- launched **PWA and native apps for <span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">[Webdunia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.webdunia.app&hl=en_IN)</span>** in **8 Indian languages**
- opened up non-obvious distribution by shipping across **Google Play** and **OEM app stores**
- ran continuous experiments across **ASO, onboarding, and UX copy** for first-time internet users
- shipped culturally grounded features like **Astrology widgets** and **video auto-scroll** to build daily habits

## the outcome

- **100K+ installs** and **75K MAU** for Bulletin across 30+ districts
- **50M+ monthly page views** across Webdunia web + mobile
- ***~30% lift*** in D7 retention
- bounce rate reduced from ***~90% to ~65%***

## the learnings

building for Bharat wasn’t about simplifying products — it was about **respecting context**. cultural relevance, speed, and habits matter more than elegant flows or global best practices. this work still shapes how i build today: stay close to users, embrace constraints, and optimise for adoption before aesthetics.
