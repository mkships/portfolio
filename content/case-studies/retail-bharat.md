## the challenge

*<span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">running a supermarket on spreadsheets*</span> 📉

at **<span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">[superk](https://www.superk.in/)**</span>, franchise owners were running supermarkets with fragmented tools, spreadsheets, and manual processes.

they lacked real-time visibility into financials, inventory, procurement, and returns, which led to stock mismatches, poor catalogue availability, operational friction, and early merchant churn.

🔴 *user pain*
- no single source of truth for store operations
- inventory audits and returns were slow, error-prone, and manual

🔴 *business pain*
 - fragile early retention
 - inconsistent demand fulfillment across locations

## the solution

*<span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">a merchant OS that retailers will thrive on*</span> 🧱

built the merchant partner product across web + mobile, building software that behaved more like an operating system than a reporting layer.

🧩 **what I built**

shipped **8+ core modules** covering:
- *financials* : invoice ledger, earnings reports
- *procurement* : catalogue, cart/checkout, returns, new product requests
- *inventory* : stock audits, inventory visibility

built no-code / low-code internal apps to:
- run inventory audits at scale across stores
- manage role-based access for merchant teams
- track physical assets (*crates*, *containers*)
- monitor orders and returns via ops dashboards

conceptualized and implemented a rules engine to dynamically control catalogue visibility, returns eligibility, and replenishment logic across 10K+ products and 150+ franchise locations

**how I worked**
- tight loops with ops, supply, and engineering to translate on-ground chaos into systems
- biased toward configurable tools over hard-coded logic to scale faster with fewer engineers
- optimized for merchant trust first, growth second

## the outcome

- **83.3% monthly retention** for newly onboarded merchants
- **75% CSAT**, driven by better control and visibility for store owners
- improved *catalogue quality*, *returns handling*, and *replenishment accuracy* at scale
- learned how small operational primitives (**rules, audits, access control**) compound into massive retention wins
- set the foundation for future merchant tooling by proving that ops-heavy B2B products win on clarity + reliability
