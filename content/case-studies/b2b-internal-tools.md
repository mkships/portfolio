## the challenge

things break fast at unicorn startups 🦄 - especially when operations scale faster than systems. and break they did at **<span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">[stanza living](https://www.stanzaliving.com/)**</span> - a unicorn startup selling managed accommodation for students and working professionals.

stanza’s supply and property operations were running on fragmented tools, manual coordination, and tribal knowledge. site managers struggled to track tasks across properties, dependencies were invisible, and delivery timelines slipped regularly. 

the business impact was real: *delayed project handovers*, *supply inefficiencies*, and *high operational costs*. the need was clear - a **single internal system** to bring structure, visibility, and accountability to supply and operations.

## the solution

i managed the product for **<span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">[stanza sigma](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stanzaliving.sigma&hl=en_IN)**</span>, an internal b2b platform built to systemize how properties get delivered.

we designed and shipped a **task scheduler and property management module** that mapped real operational workflows - not idealized ones. i worked closely with ops, supply, and site teams to translate on-ground chaos into structured flows, defined clear ownership and dependencies, and made progress measurable.

on the execution side, i owned prds, workflows, and high-fidelity prototypes (desktop + mobile), partnered with engineering and design through sprint planning and delivery, and closed the loop with training videos to drive adoption across site managers, ops, and support teams.

## the outcome

the platform reduced average project delivery TAT (turn-around-time) by **7 days (~25%)**, unlocked **$2M in annual cost savings** by cutting supply inefficiencies, and became the default system of record for internal teams.

beyond metrics, the biggest win was trust - ops teams finally had a tool built for how they actually work. the suite was later nominated for the *techSparks product innovation challenge*, recognizing its impact on improving the living experience for students and young professionals across indian cities.

>what I have learned: internal tools are products too — if adoption isn’t designed in, nothing ships no matter how good the roadmap looks.
