## the challenge

in 2018, Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s largest publicly listed company was undergoing a major HR transformation under the banner of **HR 2.0**. With a workforce exceeding **500,000 employees** across energy, retail, telecom, and media, the challenge was clear: how to reimagine the *employee lifecycle* (“hire to retire”) with a **digital-first philosophy** that could keep pace with Reliance’s scale and ambition.

the mandate from leadership, guided by the Chairman, Executive Council, CHROs, and CIOs, was to design **futuristic, benchmarked HR experiences** that improved engagement, broke silos, and enabled “Future of HR” for Reliance Group companies.

## the solution

the solution took shape as <span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">Reliance Communities</span>, a Yammer-inspired internal social and engagement platform. The platform aimed to bring together employees across divisions through:

- **personalised feeds** powered by a custom algorithm that weighted posts by who posted, engagement (likes/comments), content format (image/video), and user-defined interests.
- **gamification-first design**, deeply inspired by <span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">[Octalysis framework from Yu-Kai-Chou’s Actionable Gamification (2014)](https://yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-gamification-framework/)</span>, moving beyond points and badges to create intrinsic motivation through streaks, achievements, and reputation markers.
- **human-centric design principles** that made the experience intuitive and delightful, even at scale.
- **chatbots and workflow automations** to streamline common employee actions and HR queries.

## the outcome

- **adoption at Scale:** <span class="text-moss dark:text-moss-light">Reliance Communities</span> served as a central engagement layer for thousands of employees across business units.
- **boosted Engagement:** gamification design and feed personalisation encouraged more consistent participation compared to traditional static portals.
- **strategic alignment:** the project became a flagship initiative within HR 2.0, showcasing how AI, automation, and human-centric design could co-create next-gen HR practices.

## the learnings

for me personally, it was a chance to build at massive scale, balance global benchmarks with contextual realities, and create an employee-first solution that anticipated many trends that have since become mainstream.
