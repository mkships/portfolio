subheadline: "building and experimenting with agentic coding tools (aka vibecoding)."

over the years, i’ve worked across consumer and b2b products, close to real users, scale, and operational constraints. that experience shapes how i approach ai today — with judgment, taste, and a clear sense of what’s worth building.

lately, i’m focusing on ideas i care about and trying to create things that i (and hopefully other people 😛) genuinely enjoy using.

currently: experimenting with agentic coding and ai-driven product workflows through small tools and side projects.
